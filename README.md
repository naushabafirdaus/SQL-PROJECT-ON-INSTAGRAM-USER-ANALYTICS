# SQL-PROJECT-ON-INSTAGRAM-USER-ANALYTICS
This project is to analyze the Instagram user interactions and engagement 
With the Instagram app to provide valuable insights that can help the marketing team take better decisions for the growth of the business by helping them figure out following mentioned problems like:
MARKETING ANALYSIS:
1.	Finding the most loyal users in order to reward them. i.e those who have been using the platfrom for the longest time?
My approach for this is to Identify the five oldest users on Instagram from the provided database.
2.	Finding the inactive users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram and helping them engage by sending promotional emails.
My approach: Identifying the users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram.
3.	Marketing team had organized a contest where the user with the most likes on a single photo wins. The purpose of the contest was to encourage users to engage more and more.
My approach: Determine the winner of the contest (i.e user with most likes on a single photo) and provide their details to the team.
4.	Finding the most popular hashtags as a partner brand wants to use those hashtags in their posts to reach the most people.
My approach: Identifying and suggesting the top five most commonly used hashtags on the platform.
5.	The team wants to launch an ad campaign and for this they need to know the best day of the week to launch ads.
My approach: Determining the day of the week when most users register on Instagram and providing insights on when to schedule an ad campaign.


Also, we have extracted some insights about Investor Metrics.
1.	User Engagement: Investors want to know if users are still active and posting on Instagram or if they are making fewer posts.
My approach: Evaluate the average number of posts per user on Instagram. Also, provide the total number of photos on Instagram divided by the total number of users.
2.	Bots & Fake Accounts: Investors want to know if the platform is crowded with fake and dummy accounts.
Your Task: Identify users (potential bots) who have liked every single photo on the site, as this is not typically possible for a normal user.

Database and tools:
